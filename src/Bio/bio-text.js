export const bioText = "Ginearosa Carbone has had a proclivity for the macabre from a young age after a near death experience falling off a trampoline. She trained as a child in both Muy Thai Kickboxing as well as Eyido Japanese sword and dagger play. She can be commonly found frequenting heavy metal concerts and was a part of her own metal band, for a time, as the lead guitarist. Ginearosa boasts both Chumash American Indian as well as Italian heritage and has been raised steeped in both cultures. Ginearosa also has been known to dabble in medicine from time to time."
